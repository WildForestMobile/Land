## Introduction

When Night is Coming launched its Steam page with 30,000 wishlists, we thought we'd peaked. Publishers told us that was "good for an indie." We were expected to be grateful.

Then we studied the data. Really studied it. And we discovered that wishlist growth isn't a mystery—it's a formula. A formula we proceeded to execute so effectively that we grew from 30K to over 200K wishlists, entirely organically.

This isn't theory. This is the exact playbook we used, including the mistakes we made, the tactics that failed, and the strategies that scaled. If you want to grow your wishlists, you need to understand how Steam's visibility algorithm actually works.

## The Algorithm Reality Check

**What developers believe:** "Steam's algorithm is random."  
**What's actually true:** Steam's algorithm is predictable and exploitable (legally).

**The core equation:**
```
Visibility = (Engagement Rate × Traffic Volume) + Conversion Quality
```

Let's break down each component:

**Engagement Rate:**
- Wishlist adds per impression
- Click-through rate on capsule
- Video play rate
- Time on page

**Traffic Volume:**
- Direct traffic (your marketing)
- Tag traffic (Steam's categorization)
- Similar games traffic (algorithmic recommendations)
- Discovery queue traffic (Steam's front page)

**Conversion Quality:**
- Wishlist-to-purchase ratio
- Review score after purchase
- Playtime after purchase
- Refund rate

**The insight:** Steam rewards games that convert well and retain players. Focus on these metrics, and visibility follows automatically.

## The Capsule Image Psychology

Your capsule image is your first (and often only) impression. We tested 15 different capsule variations before finding the formula.

**What doesn't work:**
- Logo-focused designs (players don't care about your logo yet)
- Text-heavy capsules (unreadable at thumbnail size)
- Generic genre art (blends in with competitors)
- Busy compositions (unclear value proposition)

**What works:**
- Immediately identifiable core mechanic
- Strong visual contrast (stands out in lists)
- Emotional hook (creates curiosity)
- Genre signals (players know what they're getting)

**Night is Coming capsule evolution:**
- **Version 1:** Logo + generic tower → 3.2% CTR
- **Version 2:** Dragon + tower → 5.7% CTR
- **Version 3:** Dragon attacking fortification + dark atmosphere → 8.9% CTR

**The 8.9% CTR capsule drove 94% of our organic growth.**

**Testing process:**
1. Create 5 capsule variations
2. Run as Steam spotlight ads ($50 each)
3. Track CTR for each
4. Use highest-performing for main capsule
5. Re-test every 3 months

## The Tag Optimization Strategy

Tags aren't just descriptors—they're traffic channels. Most developers tag wrong.

**Common mistake:** Using obvious tags everyone uses (e.g., "Indie," "Singleplayer")

**Strategic approach:** Mix high-volume tags with specific tags where you can dominate.

**Our tag strategy:**

**High-Volume Foundation (30% of tags):**
- Tower Defense (500K+ followers)
- Survival (800K+ followers)
- Strategy (600K+ followers)

**Specific Dominance (50% of tags):**
- Base Building (150K+ followers, less competition)
- Dragons (80K+ followers, highly engaged)
- Dark Fantasy (120K+ followers, underserved)

**Long-Tail Precision (20% of tags):**
- Colony Sim (40K+ followers, perfect overlap)
- Resource Management (35K+ followers, committed audience)

**The effect:** We appeared in top 10 for specific tags, generating consistent traffic, while still getting occasional boosts from high-volume tags.

**Action step:** Map tags by follower count and competition. Target 3-5 tags where you can rank in top 20.

## The Trailer Formula That Converts

After analyzing 200+ successful indie game trailers, we identified a pattern.

**The 90-Second Formula:**

**0-5 seconds:** Hook (most impressive moment)
- Ours: Dragon swarm overwhelming a fortification

**5-20 seconds:** Core loop demonstration
- Show actual gameplay, not cutscenes
- Demonstrate the moment-to-moment experience

**20-45 seconds:** Progression showcase
- Show how the game evolves
- Demonstrate depth

**45-75 seconds:** Unique features
- What makes your game different
- Your genre twist in action

**75-90 seconds:** Emotional climax + CTA
- Most epic moment
- Wishlist prompt

**Critical specs:**
- First frame must work as standalone image (it's your video thumbnail)
- Design for silent viewing (70% watch without sound)
- Every 5 seconds should be screenshot-worthy

**Our conversion data:**
- Trailer views: 890K
- Wishlist adds from trailer: 47K (5.3% conversion)

**Common mistake:** Waiting for perfect trailer. We launched with "good enough" trailer, then updated every 3 months based on data.

## The Update Cadence System

Steam notifies wishlisters about updates. This is free marketing if you use it right.

**What doesn't work:** Random updates when you feel like it

**What works:** Strategic update cadence that builds momentum

**Our system:**

**Weekly updates (small):**
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Development progress
- Community highlights
- Keeps game active in algorithm

**Monthly updates (medium):**
- New feature announcements
- Gameplay videos
- Wishlist milestones
- Triggers wishlist reminder notifications

**Quarterly updates (major):**
- Major feature reveals
- Release date announcements
- Demo releases
- Drives traffic spikes

**The effect:** Consistent updates kept us in Steam's "active development" category, increasing our appearance in discovery queues by 340%.

**Warning:** Don't spam. Each update should have real value. Players unfollow games that update too frequently with nothing substantial.

## The Demo Timing Strategy

Releasing a demo is the highest-leverage move you can make. But timing matters.

**When to release demo:**
- ✓ When core loop is polished (not before)
- ✓ 3-6 months before full release
- ✓ During Steam festivals (3x+ visibility)
- ✓ When you can handle feedback quickly

**When NOT to release demo:**
- ✗ Early in development (kills first impressions)
- ✗ Without plan to update based on feedback
- ✗ During competitor's major releases
- ✗ When core systems aren't ready

**Our Night is Coming demo results:**
- 180K downloads
- 34% wishlist conversion (61K new wishlists)
- 89% positive feedback
- Identified 12 critical issues before launch

**Demo optimization checklist:**
- 30-60 minute playtime (longer doesn't help)
- Ends at compelling moment (creates desire for full game)
- Unique demo content (not just "first level")
- Save transfer to full game (reduces friction)

## The Review Velocity Hack

**Insight most developers miss:** Steam weighs recent reviews more heavily than old reviews.

**The strategy:** Create consistent review velocity, not just review volume.

**How we maintain velocity:**

**Pre-launch:**
- Beta access for content creators
- Staggered key distribution
- Early Access with update-driven reviews

**Post-launch:**
- Major updates trigger review prompts
- Event content creates review spikes
- Community challenges with reward incentives

**Our data:**
- Consistent 20-30 reviews per week = better visibility than 500 reviews in one week then nothing

**The algorithm logic:** Steam interprets consistent reviews as "game is still actively played," increasing discovery queue priority.

**Action step:** Plan review velocity, not just review volume. Aim for consistent weekly reviews rather than launch-day spike.

## The Wishlist Conversion Optimization

Growing wishlists is one game. Converting them to purchases is another.

**What tanks conversion:**
- Price increases after wishlisting (breaks trust)
- Long delays between wishlist and release (momentum dies)
- Launch version worse than expectations (negative reviews kill conversion)

**What boosts conversion:**
- Launch discount for wishlisters (rewards patience)
- Early Access with clear roadmap (manages expectations)
- Over-deliver on wishlist promises (positive reviews boost conversion)

**Our Night is Coming conversion:**
- 200K wishlists at launch
- 47% first-month conversion (94K purchases)
- 94% positive reviews maintained conversion momentum

**The compound effect:** High conversion → positive reviews → more visibility → more wishlists → high conversion (repeat)

## Key Takeaways

- **Algorithm Formula:** Focus on (Engagement Rate × Traffic Volume) + Conversion Quality
- **Capsule Testing:** Test 5 variations with $50 ads each, use highest CTR (aim for 8%+)
- **Tag Strategy:** 30% high-volume, 50% specific dominance, 20% long-tail precision
- **Trailer Formula:** Hook (0-5s) → Core Loop (5-20s) → Progression (20-45s) → Unique (45-75s) → Climax (75-90s)
- **Update Cadence:** Weekly small, monthly medium, quarterly major—consistency over intensity
- **Demo Timing:** During Steam festivals, 3-6 months before release, when core is polished
- **Review Velocity:** Consistent 20-30/week beats 500 in one week, plan for ongoing reviews
- **Conversion Optimization:** Launch discount + over-deliver on promises = 40%+ conversion rate

## Conclusion

Growing from 30K to 200K wishlists wasn't luck or a viral moment. It was systematic execution of Steam's visibility formula. Every tactic in this playbook is replicable. Every strategy is based on data, not hope.

The real secret? Most developers don't treat Steam like a platform to be mastered. They treat it like a lottery. It's not. It's a game with clear rules, and once you learn those rules, you can win.

Your game might be brilliant, but if nobody sees it, nobody buys it. Master visibility, and everything else becomes easier.
