## The Early Access Paradox

**The Promise:** Launch unfinished, get paid while you develop, build with your community.

**The Reality:**
- 60% of EA games never reach 1.0
- 40% have worse reviews in EA than at launch (should be opposite)
- Only 15% successfully convert EA players to long-term community

**But when done right:**
- Hades: 2 years EA → GOTY, 5M+ sales
- Valheim: Small team EA → $1M week 1 → 12M+ sales
- V Rising: EA launch → $10M month 1 → 3M+ total sales
- Baldur's Gate 3: 3 years EA → Biggest RPG of decade

**The difference:** Understanding that EA isn't "launching unfinished"—it's selling access to a development process.

Here's how to do it right.

---

## Step 1: The EA Readiness Assessment

**The Biggest Mistake:** Launching EA because you need money.

**The Hard Truth:** If your game isn't EA-ready, launching won't save it—it'll kill it.

### The EA Readiness Checklist

**Core Loop: Must Be Complete (Non-Negotiable)**

- [ ] 2-4 hours of polished gameplay exists
- [ ] Core mechanics feel good (not perfect, but good)
- [ ] Players can articulate what the game is about
- [ ] Zero game-breaking bugs in core systems
- [ ] Moment-to-moment gameplay is satisfying

**Content: Must Have Foundation**

- [ ] Enough content to justify asking price
- [ ] Clear roadmap of what's coming (visible progress path)
- [ ] Systems designed for expansion (not replacement)
- [ ] Save compatibility plan for future updates
- [ ] At least 3-5 hours of content at minimum

**Communication: Must Be Ready**

- [ ] Discord/community platform set up and active
- [ ] Update schedule planned for 6+ months
- [ ] Feedback collection system ready (not just hoping)
- [ ] Dedicated person for community management (doesn't have to be full-time)
- [ ] Crisis communication plan (for when things go wrong)

**Business: Must Be Sustainable**

- [ ] Runway for 12+ months of development post-EA launch
- [ ] Pricing strategy defined (see below)
- [ ] Revenue projections based on realistic conversion (not hopeful)
- [ ] Legal/tax structure for receiving payments

### Industry Case Study: Hades EA Readiness

**What Supergiant had at EA launch:**
- Complete first zone (Tartarus), fully polished
- 4 weapons, each with distinct feel
- Core combat loop felt amazing
- 3-5 hours of content, replayable
- Clear communication: "This is 20% of final game"

**What they didn't have:**
- Final zones (added over 2 years)
- Full story (evolved with community)
- All weapons (added based on feedback)

**Result:** 87% positive reviews in EA, maintained through to 1.0

**The lesson:** EA-ready doesn't mean feature-complete. It means the foundation is solid.

---

## Step 2: The EA Pricing Strategy

**The Common Mistake:** Pricing EA lower because "it's unfinished."

**The Better Approach:** Price based on current value, use completion % to determine discount.

### The EA Pricing Formula

```
Full Game Intended Price: $X
Current Completion %: Y%

Base EA Price = X × 0.70 (assume 70% of full value)
EA Discount = (1 - Y) × 0.30 (discount for incompletion)
Launch EA Price = Base EA Price - EA Discount

Example:
- Full game target: $25
- Base EA price: $25 × 0.70 = $17.50
- Completion at EA: 40%
- EA discount: (1 - 0.4) × 30% = 18% off base
- Launch EA price: $17.50 × 0.82 = $14.35
- Round to: $14.99 or $12.99
```

### The Price Increase Strategy

**The Psychology:** Rising prices create urgency.

**The Schedule:**

```
EA Launch (30% complete): $12.99
40% complete: $14.99 (+15%)
60% complete: $17.99 (+20%)
80% complete: $19.99 (+11%)
1.0 Release: $24.99 (+25%)

Each increase:
1. Rewards early supporters (they paid less)
2. Creates FOMO for wishlisters (buy now before increase)
3. Signals progress (price = development stage)
```

### Industry Examples

**V Rising EA Pricing:**
- EA launch: $19.99 (game was 50% complete, very polished)
- Justified by quality: Combat felt AAA despite EA
- No price increases during EA (already at target price)
- 1.0 release: Stayed $19.99 (kept promise)
- **Result:** $10M month 1, players felt it was worth it

**Valheim EA Pricing:**
- EA launch: $19.99 (game was 30% complete by plan)
- During EA: Stayed $19.99 (under-promised, over-delivered)
- 1.0 release: Still $19.99 (generous to community)
- **Result:** 12M+ sales, beloved by community

**Baldur's Gate 3 EA Pricing:**
- EA launch: $59.99 (AAA price, but Act 1 was 25+ hours)
- No price increase during 3-year EA
- Justified by Larian quality and content volume
- **Result:** Funded massive development, biggest RPG of 2023

## Step 3: The Roadmap That Sells Dreams

**Your EA roadmap isn't just a plan—it's a product that sells future value.**

### The Three-Tier Roadmap Structure

**Tier 1: Near-Term (1-3 months) - SPECIFIC**

Must include:
- Exact features with names
- Screenshots or concept art
- Concrete delivery windows ("February update")
- These are promises—don't list unless 90% sure

**Example:**
```
March 2025: The Frozen Wastes Update
- New biome: Frozen Wastes (ice caves, blizzards)
- 3 new enemy types (Ice Wraith, Frost Giant, Snow Drake)
- Cold weather survival mechanics
- 5 new weapons (ice-themed)
```

**Tier 2: Mid-Term (3-9 months) - OUTLINED**

Can include:
- Major systems described generally
- Visual concept art (not promises)
- Flexibility for community feedback
- "We're planning..." language

**Example:**
```
Summer 2025: Multiplayer & Social Features
- Co-op gameplay (2-4 players planned)
- Shared base building
- PvP arenas (subject to community feedback)
- Friends list and matchmaking
```

**Tier 3: Long-Term (9-18 months) - VISION**

Should include:
- High-level goals
- "Dream features" you want to build
- Community-voted content
- Maximum flexibility

**Example:**
```
Late 2025 / Early 2026: Endgame & Beyond
- Raid-style boss encounters
- Prestige systems for veteran players
- Mod support and workshop integration
- Community-requested features from feedback
```

### The Buffer System (Critical)

**Never promise what you can't deliver:**

```
Internal Plan: Ship Feature X in March
Roadmap Promise: Ship Feature X in "Q1" or "Early 2025"
Buffer: 4-6 weeks for unexpected issues

Result: If you ship in March, you're "on time"
        If you ship in April, you're still "on time"
        Players get "bonus" content (you had buffer all along)
```

### Industry Example: How Hades Used Roadmap Masterfully

**Supergiant's approach:**
- Near-term: Exact weapon and zone additions with dates
- Mid-term: "We're working on story content" (vague intentionally)
- Long-term: "We want 4 full zones" (vision, not promise)

**What they did brilliantly:**
- Under-promised on timeline
- Over-delivered on quality
- Adjusted roadmap based on feedback
- Never missed a promised delivery

**Result:** Community trusted them, forgave delays, celebrated every update

---

## Step 4: The Community Flywheel

**The EA Success Formula:** Engaged Community → Valuable Feedback → Better Game → More Engaged Community (repeat)

### Building the Flywheel

**Week 1-2: Foundation Phase**

- Launch Discord/forum before EA launch
- Daily developer presence (doesn't have to be long, just consistent)
- Quick wins: Address 3-5 easy player requests immediately
- Establish communication rhythm (when you'll post updates)

**Week 3-4: Recognition Phase**

- Highlight player contributions in patch notes
- Create "community heroes" role for helpful players
- Feature player creations (screenshots, videos, fanart)
- Run first community event/contest

**Month 2-3: Ownership Phase**

- Player polls for feature priority (let them choose)
- Beta test program for major features (inner circle)
- Name features/locations after community members
- Implement top 3 community requests

**Month 4+: Advocacy Phase**

- Community creates organic content
- Players recruit other players
- Self-moderating community emerges
- Community becomes your marketing team (unpaid, but eager)

### Industry Example: Valheim's Community Flywheel

**How Iron Gate built advocacy:**

**Week 1:** Launched with active Discord
**Month 1:** Devs responded to every major bug report
**Month 2:** Implemented top community QoL requests
**Month 3:** Community started creating mods, guides, content
**Month 6:** Community was self-sustaining, recruiting new players

**Result:**
- 28% of sales attributed to community word-of-mouth
- 180K+ Discord members (unpaid advocates)
- Thousands of hours of user-generated content
- Community defended game during slow update periods

### The 2-Hour Daily Rule

**Time investment:** 2 hours per day of community engagement

**Split:**
- 30 min: Read feedback, triage issues
- 45 min: Respond to top discussions
- 30 min: Create update post/content
- 15 min: Personal touches (thank contributors, etc.)

**ROI:** Community that generates millions in organic marketing and forgives delays

---

## Step 5: The Update Cadence That Keeps Players Engaged

**EA lives or dies on update consistency.**

### The Proven Cadence

**Weekly (Small Updates):**
- Bug fixes
- Minor balance changes
- Small QoL improvements
- **Impact:** Shows active development, builds trust

**Bi-Weekly (Medium Updates):**
- Small content additions (new item, enemy, etc.)
- Feature iterations based on feedback
- Community requests implemented
- **Impact:** Keeps active players engaged

**Monthly (Major Updates):**
- Significant content (new biome, boss, system)
- Roadmap milestone completions
- Big feature additions
- **Impact:** Brings back lapsed players, drives sales

**Quarterly (Massive Updates):**
- Game-changing features
- Major content drops
- Press-worthy announcements
- **Impact:** Media coverage, revenue spikes, wishlist conversion

### The Never-Miss-Update Rule

**Critical:** Never miss a scheduled update, even if you have to ship something smaller.

**Why:** Missing updates destroys trust faster than shipping smaller updates.

**Example:**

```
Bad:
- Promise monthly update
- Miss deadline
- Players lose trust
- "Abandoned EA game" narrative starts

Good:
- Promise monthly update
- Feature not ready by deadline
- Ship smaller update on time (bug fixes + one small feature)
- Explain: "Big feature delayed for quality, here's what's ready"
- Players appreciate transparency
```

### Industry Example: V Rising Update Cadence

**Stunlock Studios rhythm:**
- Weekly: Hotfixes and small balance
- Bi-weekly: Small content patches
- Monthly: Major patches (new content)
- Quarterly: Massive updates (game-changers)

**Track record:** Never missed a major update window in 18 months

**Result:** 88% positive reviews maintained, trusted by community

---

## Step 6: The Feedback Filtering System

**EA generates massive feedback. 95% of it is noise.**

### The Four-Tier Filter

**Tier 1: Critical (Ship Immediately)**
- Game-breaking bugs
- Save corruption
- Progression blockers
- Major balance that makes game unplayable

**Tier 2: Important (Next Scheduled Update)**
- Frequent player requests (30+ independent mentions)
- Moderate balance issues
- High-impact QoL improvements
- Features that enhance core loop

**Tier 3: Nice-to-Have (Roadmap Consideration)**
- Creative suggestions from community
- Niche requests (5-10 mentions)
- Long-term features that need design work
- Polish and "extra" content

**Tier 4: Ignore (Respectfully Decline)**
- Contradictory to core vision
- Requested by single players only
- Would require complete redesign
- Doesn't fit genre/style

### The Transparent Communication

**Don't just ignore Tier 4—explain why:**

```
Bad Response:
(Silence)

Good Response:
"Thanks for the suggestion! We've considered adding [Feature X], 
but it doesn't align with our vision for the game because [Reason]. 
We're focusing on [Alternative] instead, which solves the same 
problem while staying true to the core experience."
```

**Result:** Players respect your vision when you explain it.

### Industry Example: Hades Feedback Management

**Supergiant's approach:**
- Implemented 100% of Tier 1 (critical bugs)
- Implemented ~70% of Tier 2 (important requests)
- Implemented ~25% of Tier 3 (nice-to-haves)
- Politely declined Tier 4 with clear reasoning

**Community response:** "They listen AND have a clear vision"

**Result:** Trust and respect despite saying "no" frequently

---

## Step 7: The Revenue Sustainability Model

**EA isn't just initial sales—it's sustained revenue through development.**

### The Three Revenue Streams

**Stream 1: Base Game Sales (60-70% of revenue)**

Drivers:
- Price increases create urgency
- Major updates drive wishlist conversion
- Community word-of-mouth generates organic sales

**Stream 2: Supporter Packs (20-30% of revenue)**

What to offer:
- Higher-tier EA access with bonus cosmetics
- Exclusive Discord channels (behind-the-scenes)
- Credits in game (special thanks)
- Early access to beta features

**Pricing:**
- Base game: $15
- Supporter Edition: $25 (+cosmetic pack, Discord access)
- Deluxe Edition: $40 (+more cosmetics, name in credits)

**Stream 3: Cosmetic DLC (5-15% of revenue)**

Rules:
- NEVER gameplay-affecting content
- Only cosmetics (skins, decorations, etc.)
- Optional for all players
- Priced fairly ($3-8 per pack)

### Industry Example: V Rising Revenue Model

**Breakdown:**
- Base game ($19.99): 68% of EA revenue
- Supporter pack ($29.99): 27% of EA revenue
- Cosmetic DLC ($5-7): 5% of EA revenue

**Total EA revenue:** ~$10M in month 1
**Funded:** 18+ months of development post-EA

**Why it worked:**
- Each tier served different player types
- No pay-to-win (kept trust)
- Revenue enabled ambitious roadmap

## Step 8: The Path to 1.0 Release

**The Final Challenge:** Graduating EA without killing momentum.

### The 6-Month Launch Countdown

**Month 6 Before 1.0:**
- [ ] Announce target release date publicly
- [ ] Feature lock (no new features after this)
- [ ] Polish phase begins (make existing perfect)
- [ ] Marketing ramp-up starts

**Month 3 Before 1.0:**
- [ ] Release candidate builds for testing
- [ ] Performance optimization sprint
- [ ] Final content completion
- [ ] Press outreach and review copies

**Month 1 Before 1.0:**
- [ ] Release trailer production
- [ ] Price increase announcement (if planned)
- [ ] Thank EA community publicly
- [ ] Launch event planning (Twitch, Discord party)

**Launch Day:**
- [ ] EA players get special recognition (badge, item, etc.)
- [ ] Community celebration event
- [ ] Press embargo lifts
- [ ] Launch discount (lower than EA price for newcomers)

**Post-1.0:**
- [ ] Maintain update cadence (don't abandon)
- [ ] Continue community engagement
- [ ] Post-launch content roadmap
- [ ] Convert EA players to long-term community

### Industry Example: Hades 1.0 Transition

**What Supergiant did right:**

**6 months out:** Announced release window
**3 months out:** Feature lock, polish phase
**1 month out:** Epic trailer, press previews
**Launch:** EA players got exclusive cosmetics
**Post-launch:** Continued updating (DLC possibility)

**Result:**
- EA players: 91% stayed active after 1.0
- Sales spike: +340% on release week
- Reviews: Maintained 98% positive
- GOTY awards across the board

## Common EA Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Launching Too Early

**Symptom:** Core loop isn't fun yet
**Result:** Negative reviews you can never fully recover from
**Fix:** Delay until readiness checklist is 100% checked

### Mistake 2: Radio Silence

**Symptom:** Weeks between updates/communication
**Result:** "Abandoned game" narrative starts
**Fix:** Weekly minimum communication, even if "still working"

### Mistake 3: Overpromising Roadmap

**Symptom:** Miss deliverables on roadmap
**Result:** Community loses trust
**Fix:** Use buffer system, under-promise, over-deliver

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Feedback

**Symptom:** Community requests go unacknowledged
**Result:** Players feel unheard, leave negative reviews
**Fix:** Acknowledge all feedback, implement Tier 1-2, explain Tier 4 rejections

### Mistake 5: No Revenue Plan

**Symptom:** EA sales dry up, can't fund development
**Result:** Abandon EA, ruin reputation
**Fix:** Multiple revenue streams, 12+ month runway before EA

## Conclusion: EA Is a Partnership, Not a Shortcut

Early Access isn't a way to ship unfinished games and get paid. It's a way to build games *with* your community, turning players into partners.

**The Framework:**
1. **Launch ready:** Core polished, 2-4 hours fun
2. **Price smart:** Formula-based, increase over time
3. **Communicate constantly:** Roadmap + 2 hours daily engagement
4. **Update religiously:** Never miss schedule
5. **Filter feedback:** Implement critical, consider important, explain rejections
6. **Sustain revenue:** Multiple streams, fund development
7. **Graduate gracefully:** 6-month plan, reward EA supporters

**The Reality:**
- Done right: Fund development, build community, create advocates
- Done wrong: Permanent reputation damage, wasted opportunity

**The Choice:** EA is powerful. Use it responsibly.
